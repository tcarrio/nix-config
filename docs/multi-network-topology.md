# Multi-Network Topology

My devices are spread across multiple locations

- Home
- Office suite
- Cloud?

I prefer these to be as interoperable as possible

## Home

CIDR range: 192.168.1.0/24

## Office suite

CIDR range: 172.16.100.0/24

## Cloud

Additional cloud private networks can be added and included here.

These will likely fall under 10.x.0.0/8 ranges.
